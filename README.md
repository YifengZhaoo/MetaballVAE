# MetaballVAE


## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Metaball Variational Auto-encoder (MetaballVAE) algorithm. 

MetaballVAE is an particle generation algorithm 

based on parental particles with X-ray Computed Tomography



can be loaded into Metaball-Imaging Discrete Element method [MI-DELBM](https://github.com/YifengZhaoo/MI_DELBM) for simulations of fluid-particle systems. 

This repository contains the associated manuscript, code, data, and supplementary materials. We hope this work will be helpful to the research community and encourage further collaboration and exploration in the field.  If you find my work of interest, please feel free to cite, implement, or reuse it as needed. Your engagement and collaboration are highly encouraged.
